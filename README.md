# Overview
These reports are part of **Advanced Microprocessors** compulsory Lab course in Computer Engineering & Informatics Department of University of Patras for Spring Semester 2024 (Semester 8).  
For the execution of the exercises we use **ATmega4808-4809** microprocessor. The main goal is to program the microprocessor in order to simulate the function of some "smart" appliances and devices with the LEDs of the microprocessor.
